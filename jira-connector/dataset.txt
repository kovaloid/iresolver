AMQ-6134 | ActiveMQ corrupted state when local disk fills up and Queues begin to buffer to KahaDB There are already issues reporting this in AMQ 3098 and AMQ 5786 but they have been closed as Incomplete I ve left a comment on 5786 but I fear that it may get lost Fundamentally KahaDB ActiveMQ do not survive if Queues start filling up and buffering to KahaDB disk when the disk then becomes full because of an external issue in our case rsyslog Because KahaDB does not pre allocate space it seems vunerable to this case I will attach broker logs and Kahadb store during the corrupted state
